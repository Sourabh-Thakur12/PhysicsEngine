# C++ Physics Engine (From Scratch)

## Overview
This project is a custom-built physics engine developed entirely from scratch in C++. The goal is to deeply understand motion dynamics, force integration, and collision systems without relying on existing game engines.

## Objective
To implement a deterministic motion simulation system using core mathematical and physics principles.

## Learning Source
Primary theoretical foundation is based on Allen Chou’s Game Physics series.

## Planned Features
- Vector mathematics implementation
- Time integration (Euler / Semi-Implicit Euler)
- Position and velocity update loop
- Force accumulation system
- Basic collision detection
- Optional rendering using OpenGL or SDL

## Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Graphics (planned): OpenGL or SDL
- Build System: TBD

## Development Roadmap

### Week 1
- Implement Vector class
- Implement basic motion equations
- Create integration loop
- Console-based simulation

### Week 2
- Add force system
- Implement simple collision detection
- Basic visualization layer

## Future Improvements
- Broad phase collision detection
- Constraint solvers
- Rigid body rotation
- Performance optimizations
